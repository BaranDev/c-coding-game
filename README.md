# C Code Challenge Game

Welcome to the C Code Challenge Game! This game is designed to help you improve your C programming skills by solving coding challenges and testing your code against predefined solutions. You can choose between two categories: "Loops" and "Arrays." Each category includes various challenges that will test your knowledge and coding abilities.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Compile the code:
   - To compile the game, use the following command:
     ```
     gcc game.c -o game
     ```

3. Run the game:
   - Start the game with the following command:
     ```
     ./game
     ```

## How to Play

1. Choose a category:
   - You can select between "Loops" or "Arrays." Each category offers unique coding challenges.

2. Solve the challenge:
   - After choosing a category, you'll receive a coding challenge. Write your C code to solve the challenge.

3. Test your code:
   - Once you've written your solution, save it by typing "EOF" on a new line. The game will then compile and run your code to check if it meets the challenge requirements.

4. Get your score:
   - The game will evaluate your code and display a success rate as a percentage.

5. Keep practicing:
   - You can try the challenge again to improve your skills.
